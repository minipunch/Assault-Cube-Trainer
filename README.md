# Assault Cube Trainer
A console trainer made for the FPS game called "Assault Cube" on Windows.

A "trainer" modifies a game's memory to allow users to modify it's behavior on demand.  It can do things like set your weapon's ammunition count to any arbitrary amount.

### Usage
Open Assault Cube, open the Assault Cube Trainer executable, then use the following hotkeys:

- NUMPAD1 = health hack
- NUMPAD2 = infinite ammo
- NUMPAD3 = no recoil
